🌟 Project Summary

This project is a dynamic MERN stack application that enables users to create, edit, and manage blog posts.

🚀 Technologies Used:

MongoDB (with Atlas): Utilized for storing users and posts, facilitating standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Express.js: Serves as the backend framework, handling server-side logic, routing, and middleware integration.

React: Powers the frontend, providing an interactive and seamless user experience.

Node.js: The runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript, connecting all parts of the stack.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for secure authorization and the login process, ensuring that user authentication and data access are securely managed.

✨ Features:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system using JWT.

Blog Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete their blog posts.

Responsive Design: Ensures optimal viewing across various devices.

🛠️ Developer Setup Instructions
Each developer will need to create a .env file in the backend directory. This file should include:

ATLAS_KEY: Your MongoDB Atlas connection URI.

JWT_SECRET: A secret key for JWT token generation.

Example .env file content:

env
# .env
ATLAS_KEY=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here

💻 To run the back end:

\```
npm install
npm run start
\```

💻 To run the front end:
\```
npm install
npm run dev
\```
These instructions should make it easy for fellow developers to get your project up and running. Great job on providing clear and concise guidance! 😊 🌟 If you have any further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask!
